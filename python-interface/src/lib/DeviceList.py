'''
This file contains the list of ESPs allowed to be used for YSP workshop in form of a python dictionary with 'NodeID' as key and 'HardwareID' as value.
The ESPs are identified by their NodeID, which is a unique identifier for each ESP.
The NodeID is derived by converting last 32bits of the ESP's MAC address to base 10 (Decimal/int).
